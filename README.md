# Python Chess

Chess written in python. Maybe to throw at some angry AI.

play.py launches a game against a computer controlled black player who plays a legal move at random. Passing the argument cpu both players will be computer controlled and play random legal moves, this normally ends in a draw.

## To do

- Learn how to pass the state of the board and possible moves to a machine learning algorithm.
- Make legal moves etc cache until the end of the turn.

## Simplifications

- A Pawn will always be promoted to a Queen to save having to make the choice
